# Session XVII: Capsule Nets, BERT & Book Launch

*Meeting date: October 16th, 2019* 

For this session, [Dmitri Nesterenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitri-nesterenko/) and [Grant Beyleveld](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantbey/) presented on Capsule Networks (slides [here](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/study-group/blob/master/slides/2019-10-16_dmitri_nesterenko__Capsule_Nets.pdf); code demo [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MOoxhzAZnkqQyCozVg0-_OM6gtJY9K6r#scrollTo=TL4jNoGqmKMB)) and "BERT & Friends" (slides [here](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/study-group/blob/master/slides/2019-10-16_grant_beyleveld__BERT.pdf)), respectively. 

This session also served as a book launch for Jon Krohn, Grant Beyleveld, and Aglae Bassens' book, [Deep Learning Illustrated](https://www.deeplearningillustrated.com), the content of which was influenced in large part by the previous sessions of the Deep Learning Study Group. The first photo of the three authors together with their book is provided here:

## Recommended Preparatory Work

1. Capsule Networks: [here's](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829) the original paper, and there are many Medium posts and YouTube videos providing a higher-level summary of the topic
2. [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)/[RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692): those are the original papers; [here's](https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/29/facebook-ais-roberta-improves-googles-bert-pretraining-methods/) a news piece summarizing their significance

## Up Next

Topics that the Group suggested could be worth studying for our next meeting: 

* Dmitri providing three minutes' worth of Capsule Net applications
* NLP:
	* model distillation / other distilled BERT derivatives
	* multi-task learning, e.g., [decaNLP](https://decanlp.com/)
* curiosity-driven Reinforcement Learning
* [Rubix cube-solving robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZu9gjQJUQs)
